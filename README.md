**Project Title: QSAR Modeling for Monkeypox Virus Infection Treatment**

**Project Overview:**
This project, titled "Bioprospecting of Meliaceae family phytomolecules for the treatment of Monkeypox virus infection: A QSAR modeling and MD simulation approach," aims to develop a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model for predicting the efficacy of phytomolecules from the Meliaceae family in treating Monkeypox virus infection. The project involves the use of various data files and code for model development.

Project Components:

    model_rf.py:
        This Python script, model_rf.py, is a crucial component of the project. It contains the code for building the QSAR model. Users are required to provide specific parameters when running the script. The values for these parameters can be found in the associated research article mentioned in the project's title. The script employs a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to construct the QSAR model, which will predict the effectiveness of Meliaceae phytomolecules against Monkeypox virus infection.

    features.csv:
        This file, named features.csv, is used as input data for building the QSAR model. Users have the flexibility to replace this file with their own dataset, provided it follows the appropriate format and structure required for the modeling process. The features within this file play a vital role in training the model to make accurate predictions.

    processed_data.csv:
        processed_data.csv is an essential component of the project. This file contains the data that has undergone preprocessing steps, as detailed in the research paper. The preprocessing steps are critical to ensure that the input data is in the appropriate format for the QSAR modeling process. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and other necessary transformations.

    Sample Output Image File:
        To aid users in understanding the project and its results, a sample output image file is provided. This image may contain visualizations, graphs, or charts that illustrate the performance of the QSAR model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant metrics. Users can refer to this image to assess the model's effectiveness.

In summary, the project revolves around the development of a QSAR model to predict the efficacy of Meliaceae family phytomolecules in treating Monkeypox virus infection. Users are encouraged to utilize the provided code and data files, and they can replace the features.csv file with their own data if needed. The sample output image serves as a visual aid to help users interpret the model's results and assess its performance.
